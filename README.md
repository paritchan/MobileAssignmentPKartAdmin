This is a e-commerce site PKart Admin. It uses Firebase as database and uploads Product Name, Descriptions,mrp,sp[selling price] and images category wise in the database. 
This information is used by PKart user to select an item and add it to cart.

The code is in fragments and layout folder. Binding is done , Adapters are created as well as data model folder is created to fetch and store value in firebase.

Firebase and google dependencies are added onto Girdle .

I am uploading some images of firebase where data is stored.
